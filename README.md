## Purpose

The main goal of this rebuild was to deepen understanding of **TypeScript's type system**, improve code structure, and apply modular architecture while maintaining the gameâ€™s original functionality.

---

## Features

- Classic 3Ã—3 Tic Tac Toe logic
- Reusable TypeScript types (`board`, `Move`, `players`, etc.)
- Minimax algorithm for the AI opponent
- Modular architecture (`minMax.ts`, `evaluation.ts`, `common.ts`, etc.)
- SCSS-based styling with global variables and component-specific design
- Custom UI with `<dialog>` for player nickname input
- Responsive game board with emoji or letter markers
- Unit tests with **Vitest** for `evaluator` function

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** â€“ Strictly typed logic and reusable components
- **SCSS** â€“ Modular and customizable styling
- **HTML5 `<dialog>`** â€“ Native modal for name input
- **Vitest** â€“ Lightweight test runner for TypeScript
